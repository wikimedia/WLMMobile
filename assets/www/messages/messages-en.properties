about-app-header=Version Information
about-howto-header=How to use
about-howto-link=Find out how to use
about-howto-0=Taking photos of monuments is pretty easy we hope. Simply take the following steps:
about-howto-1=First locate a monument either near you or in a given country. We've added buttons to the initial page to help with this.
about-howto-2=Go to the monument! Walk, drive, fly, teleport or skip... what ever makes sense.
about-howto-3=Take a photo of the monument. Even if you are using a camera make sure you take a photo with your phone so we can remind you. Smiles are optional.
about-howto-4=Either upload the photo you took or "Save for Later". Photos saved for later stay on your phone as a record of where you've been. Whether you upload them later is up to you.
about-howto-5=When you're at home with your mug of steaming hot cocoa make sure to visit the "Uploads" page to upload the good photos. Select the ones you like and hit the upload button. Delete the embarrassing ones.
about-howto-6=Win the competition! The best photos have prizes but even if you don't win a prize you're still a winner as you have contributed to a database of millions of freely usable media files. Give yourself a cookie! Well done!
about-link-home=Get started now!
